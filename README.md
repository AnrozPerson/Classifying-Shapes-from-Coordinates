The program takes in 4 coordinates and considers what shape they are.

Uses two sets of shape checks, usesside and angle properties and diagonal properties of quadrilaterals.

Code will run as follows:

###########################

Vertex A: 0,0

Vertex B: w,1

Error: Vertex B: 1,1

Vertex C: 1,1

Error: Vertex B: 1,-1

Vertex D: 2,0

###########################

Side and angle properties for (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0) and (1, -1)

One pair of parallel sides       AB and CD

Two pairs of parallel sides       also AD and BC

All sides equal       AB, BC, CD and DA are 1.4

All angles 90 degrees       DAB, ABC, BCD, CDA

Two pairs of adjacent equal sides       AD and AB, AB and BC, BC and CD, CD and AD

CONCLUSION: The quadrilateral is a SQUARE



Diagonal properties for (0, 0), (1, 1), (2, 0) and (1, -1)      

Diagonals are perpendicular     AC and BD are perpendicular     

One diagonal bisects the other     AC bisects BD

Both diagonals bisect each other     AC and BD both bisect each other

One diagonal bisects the angles it passes through     AC and BD 

Both diagonals bisect the angles they pass through     AC and BD

Diagonals are equal in length     AC and BD are 2.0

CONCLUSION: The quadrilateral is a SQUARE
